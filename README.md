## Overview
Ace is was developed to be a fun little companion for you in your discord server. Mainly for entertainment purposes, not a utility bot like [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz/).

## Development

Ace is being built with [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia), a lua-implementation of Discord's bot APIs. For testing, I am using [luaunit](https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit).
